        <h1>What I love about Zendaya</h1>
        <p>
         I like the way Zendaya holds herself as a cool and relatable kind of
         girl. She is able to clearly artculate the reason why she's drawn to
         certain characters she plays which makes her sound more authentic. 
         This authenticity is what draws me to her as a person. I also respect how
         she stands up for justice, women rights and the things she values which is 
         shown through her interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
         I love Zendaya, she is my favourite Actress and she is also so pretty.

        <h1>Zendaya Early Life And Career</h1>
         <p>Zendaya began her career as a child model and backup dancer in Oakland, California. 
            She made her television debut as Rocky Blue in the Disney Channel sitcom Shake It Up 
            (2010 to 2013) and starred as the titular heroine in K.C. Undercover (2015 to 2018). 
            Her feature film debut was in 2017 with the superhero film Spider-Man: Homecoming, and 
            she went on to star in its sequels. 
            <br>
            Zendaya's role as Rue Bennett, a struggling drug-addicted teenager, in the HBO teen drama series
            Euphoria (2019 to present) made her the youngest recipient of the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead
            Actress in a Drama Series, which she won twice. Her other film roles include the musical 
            The Greatest Showman (2017), the romantic drama Malcolm & Marie (2021), and the science fiction epic Dune (2021).
            <br>
            In addition to her acting career, Zendaya has ventured into music. In 2011, she released the singles "Swag It Out" 
            and "Watch Me", the latter a collaboration with Bella Thorne. She signed with Hollywood Records in 2012. 
            Her eponymous debut studio album (2013) was released to moderate success. The album's lead single, "Replay", 
            reached the top 40 on the U.S. 
            <br>
            Zendaya's biggest commercial success as a musician came 
            with her Zac Efron collaboration, "Rewrite the Stars", from The Greatest Showman soundtrack in 2017. 
             Zendaya has also written and performed several songs for Euphoria.</p>

         <h1>Awards And Recognitions</h1>
         
         <p>In 2016, Zendaya was featured on Forbes' 30 under 30 list. She was included on TIME magazine's annual list of
             the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022; Dune director Denis Villeneuve wrote of her saying, 
             "She is an autonomous creative force herself. A cultural icon in the making. A person driven by pure inspiration, 
             empathy, and respect for her craft, who uses authenticity as a new superpower Zendaya is the future. And there
             is nothing more comforting to me. This is only the beginning". In that same year, Variety ranked her on its 
             list of the 500 most influential figures in global media.
             <br>
            In 2020, at age 24, Zendaya became the youngest recipient of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress 
            in a Drama Series, winning for her role as Rue Bennett in the HBO drama series Euphoria. After winning the award 
            again at the 2022 Primetime Emmy Awards, she became the youngest two-time acting winner. Zendaya received the 
            CinemaCon Star of the Year Award in 2023.
